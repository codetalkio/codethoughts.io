  Codethoughts is a place where I share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings from my journey as a Engineering Leader, Solo Founder, and Software Engineer. I write about engineering leadership, development and architecture (both high and low-level), and personal growth. I hope you find something useful here!

  For some of my other stuff, check out my GitHub Projects at [Tehnix](https://github.com/Tehnix) and in the
              [codetalk organization](https://github.com/codetalkio).

{% icon_section(name="user", title="About Christian") %}
  I started my career as a software engineer in 2008, and have since worked in various roles in the tech industry across IC and Leadership.

  After spending time in web agencies and startups, I joined Factbird in 2018 to help reimagine how manufacturing companies could quickly get insights from production, building an end-to-end IoT product from hardware to cloud.

  Right before starting codetalk I helped Famly on their mission to improve the lives of children and their families, being a key part in tripling the organization, and laying the foundation for the engineering department to grow into the amazing team they are today.

  If you're interested in a bit more detail about what my journey has been like, I made this timeline that includes some of the things I view as significant milestones or achievements in my career so far (read from the bottom and up).
