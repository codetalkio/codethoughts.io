This will be a series of blog posts where we will build up the perfect infrastructure setup for the majority of usecase, aka "The Stack". We'll be building everything on top of AWS.

Before diving in, let's first establish some goals:

- **Performant**: Latency and performance is important as this will serve end-users.
- **Low cost**: We want our base cost to be low, and our costs to scale well with high traffic. Ideally, it should cost nothing if no users are using it.
- **Low operational overhead**: It's >=2023, nobody wants to nurse servers or services anymore, things should scale up and down without intervention or oversight.
- **High flexibility**: Everything should be built with the foresight of future scalability, both organizationally, code-wise, and in the way things fit together.
- **Modular**: Pieces of the infrastructure should be opt-out, e.g. if you don't need Pub/Sub, it can be skipped.


Obviously, this is my personal opinion on it, but I'll be sharing the thinking behind each of the choices as we go along.

Some technology choices upfront:

- Everything will be infrastructure as code using [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk).
- We'll be using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) throughout for each service, as it allows us to squeeze out the most performance while still giving us a nice developer experience.
- [Federated GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/) will be our way of facilitating microservices.

## Account Structure and Governance

Reorganizing your AWS Account structure is a pain, so let's see if we can get this right from the beginning. There are a few things that direct our choices here:

- Isolation of environments to avoid sharing soft and hard limits between environments (e.g. Lambda concurrency limits, etc)
  - We will be putting each environment in their own AWS Account
- Security, audit, and control to ease GDPR requirements
  - We'll use AWS Control Tower to give us full control of sub-accounts in our Organization

Let's first sketch out the Account Governance structure, before diving into the view of each individual AWS account:

- **Control Tower**: This is your central place to control access and policies for all accounts in your organization
- **Production Multi-tenant**: Your primary production account for multi-tenant setup, and most likely were the majority of users will be
- **Production Single-tenant**: While desirable to avoid the operation overhead for single-tenant setups, its good to think in this from the get-go
- **Integration Test**: This will be the account that IaC deployments get tested on to ensure rollout works
- **Preview**: This will be used to spin up Preview Environments later on
- **Individual Developer**: Individual developer accounts to allow easy testing of IaC testing and exploration
- **Monitoring**: Centralize monitoring and observability into one account, allowing access to insights without access to sensitive logs or infrastructure from the other accounts
- **Logs**: Centralized storage of logs, which may require different access considerations than metrics and traces

## Service Infrastructure

Each of the infrastructure accounts (Production, Integration, Developer) all hold the same services and follow the same setup. The infrastructure we will make might seem complex at first, and it is, but as we go through each piece everything will start to make sense.

The diagram gets quite large, so we will split it up into three parts:

- Client to Frontend
- Client to API
- Asynchronous Work and Media


### Client to Frontend

Let's focus first on the Client to Frontend paths:

- **Public Frontend**: A simple hosting of static files in S3 with CloudFront as the CDN in front of it.
- **Internal Frontend**: Hosting of internal applications, secured behind Cognito, and otherwise similar to the Public Frontend.

  end

  classDef container stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,fill:transparent,padding:8px
  class Certificate,Frontend,Internal,API,Media,Database,Notification,Async,Monitoring container;
</pre>


### Client to API

As we can see, the two Frontends need something to talk to, let's check out the APIs:

- **API**: A Federated GraphQL setup, served using Lambda with API Gateway exposing it to the internet. WAF is added for security and protection, and CloudFront for possibility of cheaper egress pricing via commitment to a certain volume.
- **Database**: DynamoDB tables for storing data.
- **Monitoring**: XRay traces and CloudWatch metrics/alarms.

  end

  classDef container stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,fill:transparent,padding:8px
  class Certificate,Frontend,Internal,API,Media,Database,Notification,Async,Monitoring container;
</pre>

### Asynchronous Work and Media

And finally we can see the Media and Async work (the Database and some APIs reappear here as well):

- **Media**: S3 buckets for images and videos as well as MediaConvert for transcording video for wider device support.
- **Async**: SQS for asynchronous work via a queue and EventBridge for a Pub/Sub style architecture. An initial Analytics Lambda service is set up as the consumer of the Pub/Sub events.
- **Notification**: SES for emails and SNS for mobile push notifications.Z
