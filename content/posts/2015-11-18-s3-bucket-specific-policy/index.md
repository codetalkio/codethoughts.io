I have recently started caring a bit more about security on my AWS
applications, and to this end Identity & Access Management (IAM) users are a great way to limit access to
a need-to-use-only basis.

Recently I set up my IRC server to download its configuration and install files
from an S3 bucket. This meant that it needed to have read access to a specific
bucket, and for this an IAM role was created.

There are two ways to generate policies:

{{ toc() }}

I will generally advise to either use the generator completely or at least use
it for the basis of the policy you want to create.

## Using the policy generator
To access the generator go into IAM -> Policies -> Create Policy -> Policy Generator.

{{ images(paths=["S3-create-policy.png", "S3-policy-generator.png"], captions=["S3 Create Policy", "S3 Select Policy Generator"], widths=[400, 400]) }}

You will then be able to create the policy. To do this, first set the AWS
service to `Amazon S3` and then choose the actions that you want to support.
Here I've chosen `GetObject` as I just want to allow the read of an object in
the bucket, and nothing more.

Finally, you need to set the `ARN` of your bucket. This will be something like
`arn:aws:s3:::YourBucketName/*` to allow access to all elements in your S3
bucket named `YourBucketName`. It'll look a little something like in the left figure below.

{{ images(paths=["S3-edit-permissions.png", "S3-review-policy.png"], captions=["S3 Edit Permissions", "S3 Review Policy"], widths=[400, 400]) }}

Finally add the statement, and you can click next which should present you
with something like the right image above.


## Manually creating a policy
You can also skip the generator and create your own policy directly. This will
get you into a window looking much like the 'Review Policy' image in the
earlier section.

Here you just need to input a name, description and the policy document itself.
You can either use the generator as a basis for this document or craft your
own. The following is the one generated from the policy generator which can be
directly used here.

<!-- <div class="snippet-title">S3 bucket policy</div> -->
```javascript,linenos
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1447546160000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::YourBucketName/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Hopefully this will get you going and buff up your security on your AWS setup.
