I recently moved my blog from [https://codetalk.io](https://codetalk.io) (now my commercial site) to [https://codethoughts.io](https://codethoughts.io). This of course also meant, that everything linking to my old blog was now broken, which is not the best experience for any readers that I might have üòÖ

Initially I considered setting up rewrite rules somewhere for each individual post, but then thought of a much smarter way, using CloudFlare‚Äôs *Redirect Rules*, to instead redirect all direct links to posts and throw them to the new location on codethoughts.io.

The documentation for these rules are a bit sparse, so I thought I‚Äôd share how I did. First though, let‚Äôs set some context:

- The base domain changed from [https://codetalk.io](https://codetalk.io) ‚Äî> [https://codethoughts.io](https://codethoughts.io)
- All posts live under the `/posts/` path on the domain
- All post slugs are identical in dates and names
- We no longer have a `.html` ending on the new blog (i.e. what previously might have been `https://codetalk.io/posts/a-blog-post.html` would now be `https://codetalk.io/posts/a-blog-post/`)
- We‚Äôre on the free CloudFlare plan, so there‚Äôs a limit to which expressions we can use

Let‚Äôs take a look at how we do this:

{{ toc() }}

## Catching our requests on codetalk.io

First, we‚Äôll navigate to the relevant place in CloudFlare

- Go into the CloudFlare dashboard
- Select your domain (e.g. codetalk.io)
- Expand Rules in the sidebar
- Select Redirect Rules
- Create a new rule
- Give it an appropriate name, and make sure to select *Custom filter expression.*

In my case here, I specifically want to limit the logic to when the `URI Path` starts with the value `/posts`. CloudFlare will neatly demonstrate that this rule will generate the expression:

```bash
(starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/posts"))
```

In the Dashboard console it will look something like this:

## Redirecting to the new location

Now that we have caught the relevant incoming requests, let‚Äôs transform the old format into our new format.

We want to do a dynamic redirect to the new location, in the new format which is lowercase and without any `.html` at the end.

Let‚Äôs set up a redirect rule of type `Dynamic`, give it a status code of HTTP 301 (i.e. "Moved Permanently‚Äù) and use the following expression:

```bash
concat("https://codethoughts.io", substring(lower(http.request.uri.path), 0,-5))
```

Breaking this down from inner-to-outer, what we are doing:

- Grab the `http.request.uri.path` part of the request (e.g. `/posts/a-blog-post.html` of `https://codetalk.io/posts/a-blog-post.html`)
- Lowercase the value (e.g. `/posts/A-Blog-Post.html` becomes `/posts/a-blog-post.html`)
- Remove the last 5 characters by taking the `substring` from the start, `0`, to 5 characters back from the last character, `-5` (e.g. `/posts/a-blog-post.html` becomes `/posts/a-blog-post`)
- Finally, concatenate our new and rewritten URI path together with the new domain using `concat` (e.g. `/posts/a-blog-post` becomes `https://codethoughts.io/posts/a-blog-post`)

We‚Äôre avoiding any complex rewrite expressions, such as regex, because it‚Äôs a) not actually needed and b) not available on the free plan.

In the Dashboard console it will look something like this:

Hope that helps if you‚Äôre ever running into the same!
